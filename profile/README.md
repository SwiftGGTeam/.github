Hello, we are SwiftGG Translation Group, a technical community organisation focusing on the Apple ecosystem, and we have organised many technical events related to the Apple ecosystem in China.

### Technical documentation and technical blog series:

We have translated many technical articles related to Apple ecosystem (iOS, watchOS, macOS, Swift, etc.), and every article in our website has been authorised by the original author. NSHipster and AppCoda are both partners.

We are a NGO organisation, and we always try to present the forward-looking and valuable contents in the technical community to everyone's vision. Besides inviting the technical experts in the domestic technical community, we also establish contact with many excellent developers abroad to enrich the vision of developers with a broader perspective.

We look forward to more friends to join the community, together to create a better developer ecosystem!
